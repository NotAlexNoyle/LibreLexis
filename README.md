# Yiddish Keyboard (free like beer)

**Normalization Form KD (Compatibility Decomposition)**

New yiddish has some more letters than hebrew. Some other open source keyboards (dec 2018)
did not have these letters. Some non payment `le goog` store app have it ... but not FOSS.
The original `le goog` android has a yiddish layout, but linage OS not.

You can get a signed APK from here (Android 4.1+): [APK](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/no-go/YiddishKeyboard/master/app/release/click.dummer.yidkey.apk)
